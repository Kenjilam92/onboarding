1) JavaScript:
Write a function that retrieves the top 3 longest words of a newspaper headline and transforms them into hashtags. If multiple words tie for the same length, retrieve the word that occurs first.

Examples
getHashTags("How the Avocado Became the Fruit of the Global Trade")
--> ["#avocado", "#became", "#global"]

getHashTags("Why You Will Probably Pay More for Your Christmas Tree This Year")
--> ["#christmas", "#probably", "#will"]

getHashTags("Hey Parents, Surprise, Fruit Juice Is Not Fruit")
--> ["#surprise", "#parents", "#fruit"]

getHashTags("Visualizing Science")
--> ["#visualizing", "#science"]

3) Java:

Create a function that takes the memory size (ms is a string type) as an argument and returns the actual memory size.

Examples
actualMemorySize("32GB") --> "29.76GB"

actualMemorySize("2GB") --> "1.86GB"

actualMemorySize("512MB") --> "476MB"

Notes
-The actual storage loss on a USB device is 7% of the overall memory size!
-If the actual memory size was greater than 1 GB, round your result to two decimal places.
-If the memory size after adjustment is smaller then 1 GB, return the result in MB.

4) Python:

The Atbash cipher is an encryption method in which each letter of a word is replaced with its "mirror" letter in the alphabet: A <=> Z; B <=> Y; C <=> X; etc.

Create a function that takes a string and applies the Atbash cipher to it.

Examples
atbash("apple") --> "zkkov"

atbash("Hello world!") --> "Svool dliow!"

atbash("Christmas is the 25th of December") --> "Xsirhgnzh rh gsv 25gs lu Wvxvnyvi"
